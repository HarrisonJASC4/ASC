        <h1> One of my main hobbies is photography. I picked up photography the start of my sophmore year as a F&PA course. The
            reason I chose photography was too try something new but also so I can finish my F&PA credits, and not have to
            take any more courses my Junior and Senior year. This choice that I made was life changing. Ever since taking
            my first photo and later editing them, the world before my eyes has changed into something new, different, and
            beautiful. I plan on keeping up with photo throughout my highschool career, take AP Studio Art, and hopefully
            own a camera for years to come. </h1>

        <h1> Running has became one of my hobbies ever since I started Cross-COuntry and Track & Field back in Middle School.
            Back in middle school, in my eyes running was only seen as a past time something I never took seriously. It wasn't
            until 9th grade that I releazied I had to take these sports more serious. I had a solid tri season: XC, Winter,
            and Spring Track but my Sophmore Year I wanted to improve. I ended up giving up XC to train specifically for
            Track and ended up having a better track season. The role of running has played an important one in my life.
            Running has gotten me through tough times such as when our Coach died during our track meet in April 2017. Just
            like before this happened and after, running and my running family was there. RUnning gave me a space to think,
            be at peace, value the concept of time, and made me mentally strong. </h1>
